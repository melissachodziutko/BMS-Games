## Creating and Working Off a New Branch
Below are step-by-step instructions for working on and merging your own branch with main. Follow these steps in Git Bash.

**Create and Checkout Your New Branch**
> git pull

> git checkout -b YOUR_LASTNAME

You can now change the project as you would normally. When you are ready to commit your 
changes, move on to the next steps.

**Pushing Your Changes to Remote for the First Time**
> git commit -a -m "A message detailing your changes"
  
> git push --set-upstream origin YOUR_LASTNAME

**Pushing Your Changes to Remote Any Other Time**
> git commit -a -m "A message detailing your changes"
  
> git push

This will push your changes to the remote copy of your branch. It will not affect the main branch. Notify one of the programmers when you've made changes and they will create a PULL REQUEST to merge your changes with the main branch.
